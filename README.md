# Frigate NVR™ - Realtime Object Detection for IP Cameras

\[English\] | [简体中文](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/dev/README_CN.md)

A complete and local NVR designed for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) with AI object detection. Uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform realtime object detection locally for IP cameras.

Use of a GPU or AI accelerator is highly recommended. AI accelerators will outperform even the best CPUs with very little overhead. See Frigate's supported [object detectors](https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/object_detectors/).

- Tight integration with Home Assistant via a [custom component](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration)
- Designed to minimize resource use and maximize performance by only looking for objects when and where it is necessary
- Leverages multiprocessing heavily with an emphasis on realtime over processing every frame
- Uses a very low overhead motion detection to determine where to run object detection
- Object detection with TensorFlow runs in separate processes for maximum FPS
- Communicates over MQTT for easy integration into other systems
- Records video with retention settings based on detected objects
- 24/7 recording
- Re-streaming via RTSP to reduce the number of connections to your camera
- WebRTC & MSE support for low-latency live view

## Contributing

*Excerpt from upstream `CONTRIBUTING.md`:*

# Contributing to Frigate

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Frigate. This document covers the expectations and guidelines for contributions. Please read it before submitting a pull request.

All participation in this project, including pull requests, issues, and discussions, is covered by our [AI policy](AI_POLICY.md).

## Before you start

### Bugfixes

If you've found a bug and want to fix it, go for it. Link to the relevant issue in your PR if one exists, or describe the bug in the PR description.

### New features

A pull request is more than just code — it's a request for the maintainers to review, integrate, and support the change long-term. We're selective about what we take on, and prioritize changes that align with the project's direction and can be responsibly maintained in the long term.

**Large or highly-requested features** raise the bar even higher. Popularity signals demand, but it doesn't pre-approve any particular implementation. The bigger the change, the higher the long-term cost, and the more important it is that we're aligned on scope and approach before any code is written. A large PR that lands without prior discussion is unlikely to be merged as-is, no matter how well it's implemented.

Before writing code for a new feature:

1. **Check for existing discussion.** Search [feature requests](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/discussions) to see if it's been proposed or discussed. Feature requests tagged with "planned" are on our radar — we plan to get to them, but we don't maintain a public roadmap or timeline. Check in with us first if you have interest in contributing to one.
2. **Start a discussion or feature request first.** This helps ensure your idea aligns with Frigate's direction before you invest time building it. Community interest in a feature request helps us gauge demand, though a great idea is a great idea even without a crowd behind it.

## AI usage policy

AI tools are a reality of modern development and we're not opposed to their use. But we need to understand your relationship with the code you're submitting, and we need to hear from you rather than from your AI assistant.

**Read the [AI policy](AI_POLICY.md) before you open a pull request.** It is short, and it applies to everything you post here. The parts that most often catch people out:

- A person has to be in the loop. Don't wire a bot or agent up to open pull requests

Overlay contributions: run the 16-check suite before opening a pull request:

```sh
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

## Benchmarks

Measured by the Anticloud assurance suite. Every value below is read from this
project's `BENCH.json`, produced by a real run — the SHA3-256 of that file is
`83b615505ab3b1429cb84de346cc15f208fd922a8f70dede925f09ca79bc95c9`.

**Overall: 16/16 checks passing.**

See `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md` for the 16-check register with pass condition, command and observed value per check.

Framework folders in `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` state the control set and the
evidence source bound to each control. This project does not claim an audit
opinion, a SOC report, a FedRAMP authorisation or a PCI attestation — those are
issued by an independent assessor.
